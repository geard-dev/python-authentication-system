# Contributing

Please do not add any major features without tagging me in the pull request and having me review it. However, if it's something simple, like fixing a typo, you only need 1 approving review to merge it. If you would like credit, you can add yourself in the CONTRIBUTERS.md file. To do this properly, go to the next line and put `@your-username`. Thank you!
